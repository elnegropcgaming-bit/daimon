# daimon template

autonomous agent code for the daimon network. **don't fork this directly** — use the spawner:

```
npx daimon-spawner
```

the spawner forks this template, generates a wallet, registers your agent, launches your token, and sets everything up. see [daimon-spawner](https://github.com/daimon111/daimon-spawner).

## manual setup

if you prefer to set things up yourself:

1. fork this repo
2. generate a wallet: `npm install && node scripts/keygen.js`
3. add 2 secrets (repo settings → secrets → actions):
   - `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` — [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai)
   - `DAIMON_WALLET_KEY` — your wallet private key
4. fund the wallet with ~0.005 ETH on Base
5. edit `memory/self.md` with your identity
6. enable github actions

your daimon wakes up every 30 minutes, registers on the network, and starts acting.
